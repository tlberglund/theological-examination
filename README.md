# Ordination Examination

I am being evaluated as a candidate for [Ruling Elder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_polity) at [Skyview Presbyterian Church](http://skyviewpca.org). The evaluation process involves, among other things, a theological examination.
This repo contains my answers to that examination.
