### Chapter 1: The Holy Scriptures

1. What does the Confession mean by: "the former ways of God's revealing Himself unto His Church are now ceased" (1.1)?
2.  What is meant by:
  * The necessity of Scripture?
  * The authority of Scripture?
  * The sufficiency of Scripture?
  * The clarity of Scripture?
3. **What is meant by good and necessary consequence?**

Valid logical inferences that are consistent with the _regula fidei_.

4. **Show from Scripture the inerrancy and the inspiration of the Bible.**
  * [Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Lk 16:29)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+16%3A29/)
  * [Emmaus Walk (Lk 24:27)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+24%3A27)
  * [Paul: All Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim 3:15-17)](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Timothy+3%3A15-17/)
  * [Peter: Paul's stuff is hard (2 Pet 3:16)](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Peter+3%3A16/)
  * [Paul pointing back to OT (Rom 15:4)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+15%3A4/)

5. Does inspiration mean that every part of Scripture is equally significant?
6. **Does the authority of Scripture rest on the Church?**
No. The Church discovers Scripture; it does not define it. The first 300 years of the church tell an encouraging story of how God's people recognize his voice, as consensus slowly formed through a robust internal dialog about the few books that were disputed during that time.

7. **Are you personally committed to the doctrine of biblical inerrancy?**
Yes. The [Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy) is a good summary of my view.

### Chapter 2: Of God and the Holy Trinity

1. Support from Scripture the Deity and the Humanity of Jesus Christ.
2. Is Jesus Yahweh (Jehovah)?
3. **Support from Scripture the doctrine of the Trinity.**
  * [God is One (Deut 6:4)](http://www.esvbible.org/Deuteronomy+6%3A4/)
  * [Baptism of John (Mt 3:16-17))](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+3%3A16-17/)
  * [Deity of Christ (John 1:14-18)](http://www.esvbible.org/John+1%3A14-18/)
  * [Procession of Spirit (John 15:26)](http://www.esvbible.org/John+15%3A26/)
  * [Proto-Trinitarianism in 1 Cor (1 Cor 12:4-6)](http://www.esvbible.org/1+Corinthians+12%3A4-6/)

4. **Are you personally committed to doctrine of the Trinity?**
Yes. This is a part of the creedeal definition of what it means to be a Christian. One cannot deny the Trinity and also have saving faith in Christ.

### Chapter 3: God's Eternal Decree

1. **What is the decree of God?**
The declaration of God in which he freely and immutably, from all eternity, ordains all things that come to pass. It's pretty awesome.

2. What Scriptures teach that God has sovereignly, freely, unconditionally, and graciously elected some from before the foundation of the world? Ephesians 1:4; Romans 8:29.
3. Is God's election based upon foreknowledge?
4. How do you understand Romans 9:18, 22-23?
5. **Was Jesus' death predestined?**
Yes. I take no position on the logical ordering of the fall and the death of Christ, but both events were ordained from all eternity.

6. **How is the doctrine of Predestination important for assurance of salvation?**
God ordains all states of affairs, including whether I will have saving faith. Thus my faith rests in God's decree, not in the quality of my faith or repentance.

7. **Are you personally committed to the biblical Westminster doctrine of Predestination?**
Yes.

### Chapter 4: Creation

1. **What is God's work of creation?**
God's work in creating the physical universe (matter, energy, space, and time) from out of nothing.
2. **What is meant by the creation of man in God's image?**

3. How should this affect the way we view others and ourselves?
4. What was man like in his original state?
5. Are the theories of evolution compatible with the biblical doctrine of creation?
6. **Are you personally committed to the biblical Westminster doctrine of creation?**
Yes, although I think a good case can be made that the Westminster Divines affirmed a creation in six literal 24-hour days, which I deny. Inasmuch as I am qualified to hold a position, I am most sympathetic to the Framework View of Genesis 1, which allows me also to affirm an ancient (~13 billion year) cosmos and a long history of life on Earth.


### Chapter 5: Providence
1. **What are God's works of providence?**
God's governing and upholding of the physical unviverse and directing the affairs of his creatures in it. Providence is distinguishable from God's degree, but not separable from it.

2. To whom is 5.1-4 addressed compared to 5.5?
3. How would you answer someone who says that if God controls everything, then things will turn out the same regardless of what we do?
4. Support from Scripture that God "foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, controls and rules".
5. **Are you committed to the view that God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, controls and rules all things for His own glory and disposes all things to the good of His Church?**
Yes.


### Chapter 6: The Fall of Man, Sin and its Punishment
 
1. What is the original sin?
2. What are the effects of the fall?
3. What is meant by original sin?
4. What is meant by imputation?
5. How did the fall affect our will?
6. **What is meant by total depravity?**
Every part of the human person is affected by sin.

7. **How am I involved in Adam's first sin?**
God was pleased to represent all human beings in Adam, as if to federate the disposition of all people in one head. See [Romans 5:12-21](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+5%3A12-21/).

8. **Are you committed to the doctrine of Total Depravity?**
Yes.


### Chapter 7: God's Covenant with Man

1. What is a covenant in terms of God's relationship with man?
2. **What is meant by the Covenant of Works?**
The agreement God made with Adam wherein God would preserve Adam's life if Adam would obey God.

3. **The Covenant of Grace?**
The agreement God made with Adam wherein God would save Adam's race from their sin. Put in the language of the Larger Caetchism (question 30), God, "of his mere love and mercy delivers his elect out of it, and brings them into an estate of salvation."

4. What are the various administrations of the covenant?
5. What are the signs and seals of the Covenant?
6. **Have your children been baptized?**
All three of them, yo.

7. **Are you committed to Covenant Theology?**
Yes. I take this phrase to mean that "covenant" is a useful theological concept with which to explain redemptive history. A covenant is an agreement in which God engages with his people. Hisorically he has used locally recognizable forms to enact these covenants (e.g., [Gen 15:7-21](http://www.esvbible.org/Genesis+15%3A7-21/)).


### Chapter 8: Christ the Mediator
 
1. Why is Christ as Mediator necessary for the salvation of God's elect?
2. What did Christ accomplish in His mediatorial office?
3. Why was it necessary that the Mediator be fully human as well as fully divine?
4. Distinguish between the humiliation and exaltation of Christ.
5. **Support from Scripture that Christ shed His blood only for the elect and truly accomplished their salvation.**

"Only for the elect" is substantially a systematic argument. Scripture speaks of Christ doing redeeming work on the cross, and we conclude that such redeeming work applies only to those who are actually saved, since effecting potential salvation for everyone is no work at all.

[John 6:37](http://www.esvbible.org/John+6%3A37/): all the Father gives me will come to me.
[Eph 1:4-8](http://www.esvbible.org/Ephesians+1%3A4-8/): predestined to be redeemed.
[1 Tim 4:10](http://www.esvbible.org/1+Timothy+4%3A10/): savior of all people, especially those who believe


6. **What is correct or incorrect about "the free offer of the Gospel?"**
It is correct to offer the Gospel freely to all human beings. One cannot point to a random human and say, "Jesus died for you," but one can call that person to repent and believe in Christ.

7. **Are you in agreement with the doctrine of particular redemption? (Limited atonement.)**
Yes.


### Chapter 9: Free Will
 
1. **Under what circumstances is man free and in what sense not free?**
Man is free to do what he wants. Man is not free to do other than what God has ordained.

2. Distinguish between free will and moral responsibility.
3. What does Scripture teach concerning Total Inability?
4. How is man's will involved in coming to salvation?
5. **Cite the Five Points of Calvinism and give an explanation of each. (TULIP)**
* Total Deprvaity: no part of the human person is unaffected by sin
* Unconditional Election: God chooses those whom he would save apart from any merit in those people
* Limited Atonement: the saving work of Christ applies specifically to the Elect
* Irresitible Grace: once God calls a sinner, that sinner always responds
* Persevereance of the Saints: once God makes a person spiritually alive, that person cannot spiritually die again

6. **Are you personally committed to the doctrine of Total Inability?**
Yes.

### Chapter 10 -- Effectual Calling

1. Distinguish between the general call of the gospel and effectual calling.
2. **Who are the subjects (initiator) of effectual calling? Who are the objects of?**
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the subjects. The objects are elect sinners.

3. What means does God use in calling His own unto Himself?
4. State the ordo salutis as you understand it. (Calling, Regeneration, Justification, Sanctification, Glorification); Romans 8: 28-29.
5. **Are you committed to the doctrine of irresistible grace?**
Yes.


### Chapter 11: Justification
 
1. **Give a scriptural definition of justification.**
A sinner believes God, and that faith is credited to the believer as righteousness. That is, the sin of the believer is exchanged with the righteousness of Christ as if in a legal transaction.

See [Romans 4:1-8](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+4%3A1-8/), [Eph 2:1-10](http://www.esvbible.org/Ephesians+2%3A1-10/), [Zech 3:1-3](http://www.esvbible.org/Zechariah+3%3A1-3/).

2. **What is the “ground” of justification?**
The righteousness of Christ.

3. **How does faith relate to God's act of justification?**
Faith is the instrumental cause of God's justification. It is the thing through which God performs the legal declaration that is justification.

4.  Romans 4:1 gives Abraham as an example of justification by faith. James  2:22-23 says Abraham is an example of justification by works. Explain this apparent contradiction.
5. **Distinguish between justification and sanctification. (LC 77)**
Justification is God's declaration that a sinner is righteous, made because the sinner has faith in the work of Christ. It is monergistic. Justification is the work of the Holy Spirit and the believer in which the believer sins less over time. It is synergistic.

6. **What does being justified by grace through faith mean in your life?**
It means, despite my awful sin, I do not need to worry. God has saved _me_; I have not worked to save myself. It also means I can be confident in my justification, because I am able to be confident that I have faith. I cannot directly perceive God's legal accounts (as it were), but I do have incorrigible first-person access to my own mental states, and faith is among them.


### Chapter 12: Adoption
 
1. **What privileges do the Children of God enjoy?**
Quoting from WCF Chapter 12:

    All those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have His name put upon them, receive the spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness,[5] are enabled to cry, Abba, Father,[6] are pitied,[7] protected,[8] provided for,[9] and chastened by Him as by a Father:[10] yet never cast off,[11] but sealed to the day of redemption;[12] and inherit the promises,[13] as heirs of everlasting salvation.[14]
m

2. What is the meaning of Romans 8:16-17?
3. Are we true children of God if we are not chastened for disobedience?
4. What is the significance of calling God Abba?


### Chapter 13: Sanctification
 
1. **How does Scripture (WSC) define sanctification?**
Being in the likeness of Christ ([Romans 6:5](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+6%3A5/)); having the old man crucified/destroying the body of sin ([Romans 6:6](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+6%3A6/)); crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts ([Gal 5:24](http://www.esvbible.org/Galatians+5%3A24/)); strengthened with all might, endurance, patience, joy; ([Col 1:11](http://www.esvbible.org/Colossians+1%3A11/)); bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God ([1 Cor 7:1](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Corinthians+7%3A1/)).

2. What means does God use in sanctification?
3. **Is sanctification of God’s grace entirely? What are the means of grace?**
Sanctification is syngerstic, just as justification is monergistic. To be sanctified, I agree to participate in and cooperate with the means of grace: prayer, fellowship, the Sacraments, the Word (preached and read individually), singing, exhorting, etc.

4. How is sanctification different from justification?
5. How does the Law of God relate to my sanctification?
6. **Can Christ be Savior yet not Lord over believer?**
For a few minutes, sure; but not in the long term. [James 2:14-26](http://www.esvbible.org/James+2%3A14-26/) makes it clear that faith entails works also.

### Chapter 14: Saving Faith
