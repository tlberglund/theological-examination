### Chapter 1: The Holy Scriptures

1. What does the Confession mean by: "the former ways of God's revealing Himself unto His Church are now ceased" (1.1)?
2.  What is meant by:
  * The necessity of Scripture?
  * The authority of Scripture?
  * The sufficiency of Scripture?
  * The clarity of Scripture?
3. **What is meant by good and necessary consequence?**

Valid logical inferences that are consistent with the _regula fidei_.

4. **Show from Scripture the inerrancy and the inspiration of the Bible.**
  * [Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Lk 16:29)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+16%3A29/)
  * [Emmaus Walk (Lk 24:27)](http://www.esvbible.org/Luke+24%3A27)
  * [Paul: All Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim 3:15-17)](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Timothy+3%3A15-17/)
  * [Peter: Paul's stuff is hard (2 Pet 3:16)](http://www.esvbible.org/2+Peter+3%3A16/)
  * [Paul pointing back to OT (Rom 15:4)](http://www.esvbible.org/Romans+15%3A4/)

5. Does inspiration mean that every part of Scripture is equally significant?
6. **Does the authority of Scripture rest on the Church?**
No. The Church discovers Scripture; it does not define it. The first 300 years of the church tell an encouraging story of how God's people recognize his voice, as consensus slowly formed through a robust internal dialog about the few books that were disputed during that time.

7. **Are you personally committed to the doctrine of biblical inerrancy?**
Yes. The [Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy) is a good summary of my view.

### Chapter 2: Of God and the Holy Trinity

1. Support from Scripture the Deity and the Humanity of Jesus Christ.2. Is Jesus Yahweh (Jehovah)?3. **Support from Scripture the doctrine of the Trinity.**
  * [God is One (Deut 6:4)](http://www.esvbible.org/Deuteronomy+6%3A4/)
  * [Baptism of John (Mt 3:16-17))](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+3%3A16-17/)
  * [Deity of Christ (John 1:14-18)](http://www.esvbible.org/John+1%3A14-18/)
  * [Procession of Spirit (John 15:26)](http://www.esvbible.org/John+15%3A26/)
  * [Proto-Trinitarianism in 1 Cor (1 Cor 12:4-6)](http://www.esvbible.org/1+Corinthians+12%3A4-6/)

4. **Are you personally committed to doctrine of the Trinity?**
Yes. This is a part of the creedeal definition of what it means to be a Christian. One cannot deny the Trinity and also have saving faith in Christ.

### Chapter 3: God's Eternal Decree

1. **What is the decree of God?**
The declaration of God in which he freely and immutably, from all eternity, ordains all things that come to pass. It's pretty awesome.

2. What Scriptures teach that God has sovereignly, freely, unconditionally, and graciously elected some from before the foundation of the world? Ephesians 1:4; Romans 8:29.
3. Is God's election based upon foreknowledge?
4. How do you understand Romans 9:18, 22-23?
5. **Was Jesus' death predestined?**
Yes. I take no position on the logical ordering of the fall and the death of Christ, but both events were ordained from all eternity.

6. **How is the doctrine of Predestination important for assurance of salvation?**
God ordains all states of affairs, including whether I will have saving faith. Thus my faith rests in God's decree, not in the quality of my faith or repentance.

7. **Are you personally committed to the biblical Westminster doctrine of Predestination?**
Yes.

### Chapter 4: Creation

1. **What is God's work of creation?**
God's work in creating the physical universe (matter, energy, space, and time) from out of nothing.
2. **What is meant by the creation of man in God's image?**

3. How should this affect the way we view others and ourselves?4. What was man like in his original state?5. Are the theories of evolution compatible with the biblical doctrine of creation?6. **Are you personally committed to the biblical Westminster doctrine of creation?**
Yes, although I think a good case can be made that the Westminster Divines affirmed a creation in six literal 24-hour days, which I deny. Inasmuch as I am qualified to hold a position, I am most sympathetic to the Framework View of Genesis 1, which allows me also to affirm an ancient (~13 billion year) cosmos and a long history of life on Earth.


### Chapter 5: Providence
1. **What are God's works of providence?**
God's governing and upholding of the physical unviverse and directing the affairs of his creatures in it. Providence is distinguishable from God's degree, but not separable from it.
2. To whom is 5.1-4 addressed compared to 5.5?3. How would you answer someone who says that if God controls everything, then things will turn out the same regardless of what we do?4. Support from Scripture that God "foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, controls and rules".5. **Are you committed to the view that God foreordains whatsoever comes to pass, controls and rules all things for His own glory and disposes all things to the good of His Church?**
Yes.
